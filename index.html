          <p style="color:darkgray;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;text-align:left;padding-left:20px;font-size:16.45px;">Founded in 2010 by H. H. Shri Vishwavallabha Theertha Swamiji of Shri Sode Vadiraja Mutt – one of the 700 plus years old Ashta Mutts associated with the world famous Shri Krishna temple of Udupi in Karnataka – Shri MadhwaVadiraja Institute of Technology & Management (SMVITM), situated at Bantakal in Udupi has carved a niche for itself in imparting quality engineering education in the coastal Karnataka region. Shri Swamiji started the institute with the sublime objective of providing quality higher education to the needy student community at affordable costs. The motto Engineering your Career and Character with Care well reflects the objectives and philosophy of the institute. Despite, being the youngest institute in the region, SMVITM has made remarkable strides in its journey towards excellence over the past five years and has emerged as the most promising engineering institute with its well-qualified and motivated faculty, state-of-the-art infrastructure and distinguished learning-centric facilities.
            At present, SMVITM, with a total student intake of 441 per year, offers Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) courses in Civil Engineering, Computer Science & Engineering Electronics & Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. Currently, 1562 students are pursuing their engineering education at the institute. Despite being located in a rural area, SMVITM ensures that its students are well trained in existing engineering practices and acquainted with the latest industrial trends.<br>
            <br>Established in the year 2010 under the aegis of Shri Sode Vadiraja Mutt Education Trust®, Udupi, Shri Madhwa Vadiraja Institute of Technology & Management (SMVITM) has emerged as ‘A Promising Institution with a Distinction’. It is located in a picturesque village called Vishwothama Nagar in Bantakal, near world famous temple town Udupi, a relatively small but a culturally vibrant and intellectually enlightened town situated in coastal Karnataka.
            The institute campus is on the Katapady-Belman road, about 6 km off NH 66, 12 km away from Udupi and well connected to Kundapura, Karkala and Mangalore by road. Shri Shri Vishwavallabha Theertha Swamiji of Paryaya Shri Sode Vadiraja Mutt, Udupi and the president of the Trust, at the very young age of 24 years promoted SMVITM to reach the goal of up-lift of the underprivileged in the form of basic education, in general and technical education, in particular.
